Information about some of the personal projects I've worked on over the years,
along with whatever documentation I can scrape together.

## Future Projects

### Digital Projector

Dismantle an LCD monitor and put its panel onto the surface of an overhead
projector, to make a poor man's digital projector.

### Shifty Jack O' Lantern Eyes

Use a microprocessor and a servo to make my Jack O' Lantern's eyes move back
and forth.

### Shifty Window Eyes

Same thing as the Jack O' Lantern, but scaled up to rotate beach balls back and
forth in a window.

## Completed

### Answers Overboard!

A 2D Unity-based game I made for Thinksy's February 2015 hackathon.  The idea
is to steer a helicopter to pick up answers that are floating in water, and
drop them onto the rescue ship.  I was proud of the game, but accidentally made
the flight speed dependent on the frame rate, meaning it was unplayable on
devices that ran it more slowly than my test hardware!  Suffice it to say, I
did not win the hackathon.

### Global Game Jam Entry

A 2D Unity-based game my team and I made in 48 hours for the 2015 Global Game
Jam.  The idea is that you play a pixel on its journey through various retro
arcade games.  Win a game and you transition to another one -- lose, and you
take a different path, to a different game.

### Leap Motion SumoBot

A project I made at RobotsConf 2014.  The hardware is a standard SumoBot I
assembled from a kit, and the software implements custom proportional steering,
using Leap Motion with the Johnny Five javascript library.

### Nerf Blowgun

A very cheap, very fun toy made with less than $3 of hardware.  Long firing
range, and *shockingly accurate* as Nerf guns go.

### PyWeek Entries

A couple of tech demos that I never finished.  The first is a cat getting
pulled on a trash can lid.  Make him jump over obstacles -- but keep him
fuzzy-side-up, or he loses one of his nine lives.  The other is a little
wobbling easter egg.  He can hop, lean, and shoot jelly beans with a kick.  He
gets nervous if it looks like he's going to fall over, and it's game over if he
does.

### Transposition Cipher cracker

A tool to crack a transposition cipher using a genetic algorithm.  I was taking
a codemaking and codebreaking course in college, and I was having a hard time
with one of the homework assignments, so I wrote this software to solve the
cipher for me.  It didn't find the complete solution, but it found enough of it
that I could recognize what the rest was supposed to be.

### Electroluminescent Gloves

A project I made while home for Spring Break.  Cotton gloves with
electroluminescent wire threaded along the palm and fingers, for using sign
language in the dark.

### COTA notifications

A really basic hack, way back in the early 2000's I think, to let me know when
the bus was running late.  If it was on schedule or if class ran late, I
wouldn't have time to make it to the bus stop -- it would be a long wait until
the next one, I might as well leave the stop and wait somewhere else warm.  On
the other hand, if the bus was late and class ended on time, I could *just*
catch the bus, and get home quickly.

The transportation authority had a web site where riders could check the bus
locations, but I didn't have a smartphone.  What I did have was Python, and an
email address that would forward (as SMS) to my phone.  So, I hacked together a
script that would scrape the GPS location of the bus I wanted to catch, and
text me if it was running late, so I'd know whether to run to the stop, or give
up and go to the library.
